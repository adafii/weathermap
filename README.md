The goal of this project was to learn about mapping and networking APIs in Qt/QML, and how to use those to interact with an external APIs over HTTP. 

The program shows an interactive map from OpenStreetMap into which user can add and remove draggable markers with right mouse button. The program uses reverse geocoding to show the name of the place under marker. [Locationforecast API](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/documentation) is used to show the current air temperature and weather forecast symbol for the place.
